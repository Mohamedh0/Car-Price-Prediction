# Car Price Prediction Project ðŸš—

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Project! This repository showcases my work on predicting car prices using various machine learning models. The project involves a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to predict car prices based on various features using different machine learning algorithms. Through this project, I aimed to identify the most accurate model and gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: A basic algorithm to establish a relationship between the target variable and predictors.
- **XGBRegressor**: An advanced ensemble method for better handling of complex data.
- **Decision Tree**: A simple model that makes decisions based on feature values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved performance.

## Techniques Applied

- **Data Preprocessing**: Included cleaning and transforming raw data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Encoding Categorical Columns**: Converted categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.
- **Standard Scaling**: Applied feature normalization to standardize the range of features.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of each model was compared using appropriate evaluation metrics to determine the most accurate predictor for car prices. The results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, helping to identify the best performer.
